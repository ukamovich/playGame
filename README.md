# playGame

We’ve gotten started making a number guessing game. We’ve written a function playGame() which expects a line of user input corresponding to a guess. Input read through the terminal is received as a Buffer object with a new line character at the end, so we’ve converted it to a string and trimmed off the unnecessary new line character. We then feed the processed input into the testNumber() function required in from game.js.

Read through the code and try to figure out what has been done and what is left to do to make this an interactive command line program (game.js includes the core game logic, but reading through it is optional).
